Chevereto-Free is an image hosting software that allows you to create a beautiful and full-featured image hosting website on your own server. It's your hosting and your rules, so say goodbye to closures and restrictions.

In a nutshell, Chevereto-Free is:

- üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª An indie developed [mature project](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto#history)
- ‚ù§ A large [Community](https://chevereto.com/community/)
- ü§Ø Used everywhere, including at [high scale](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto#-powered-by-chevereto)
- ‚öñ Open Source Software

## ü§Ø Viva la modernizaci√≥n!

The Chevereto software **is being heavily modernized** by updating the technology stack. The new Chevereto is **extensible**, **progressive**, **headless** and is the most [_ch√©vere_](https://chevere.org/get-started/#name-meaning) Chevereto ever made.

It is also **evolving the business**, specially for [how users will monetize](https://rodolfo.is/2021/01/20/thoughts-on-monetize-chevereto-installations/) their instances.

üëçüèæ Check the all-new Chevereto at [chevereto/chevereto](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto) for more information and to contribute to its development.

## It's a fork

Chevereto-Free is a fork of Chevereto V3 (proprietary software) in which the essential features are preserved. This fork **removes**:

- Social network login
- External Storage
- Likes + Followers
- Manage Banners

This fork trends to be more stable than the proprietary software (way less frequent updates). If you really need the edge features consider to go with the paid edition.

```
